As most people already know, Minecraft is programmed in Java. But have you ever wondered exactly how Notch managed to create such a complex game using this language? I asked myself the same question, and after some research, I think I can shed some light on the matter.

While it's true that many developers today try to recreate Minecraft using languages like C# or C++, often within IDEs and game development engines designed specifically for that purpose, the original Minecraft took a different path. From the beginning, it was developed in Eclipse, an IDE tailored for Java programming. Unfortunately, documentation and resources explaining how to build a game like Minecraft in this environment are now outdated and scarce.

To address this gap, I've set out to not only explore this original approach but also teach how to build a custom game engine from scratch using OpenGL libraries. This method provides full control over shaders and rendering processes, which is essential for replicating the visual and performance aspects of Minecraft.

 Currently, my project includes several main features:

Mesh generation for cubes, using 10 floats per vertex to store Position (3), Normal (3), UV (2), Shadow (1), and Ambient Occlusion (1).

Generation of chunks with dimensions of 16x16x16 cubes, currently set in a flat world environment.

Efficient loading and unloading of chunks, including dynamic modifications.

First-person gameplay mechanics, allowing players to interactively place and remove blocks.

Following this approach, my goal is to provide a deeper understanding of the original Minecraft development process and offer practical guidance for those interested in game programming with Java and OpenGL.
